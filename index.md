## About 

I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services. Previously, I was a Postdoc Researcher in [Clark Barrett](https://theory.stanford.edu/~barrett/)'s Group
at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). 
Before that, I was a Postdoc Researcher at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu),
[Embedded Systems Unit](https://es.fbk.eu), led by [Alessandro Cimatti](https://es.fbk.eu/people/cimatti/).
I recieved my PhD in May 2018 from [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/),
under the supervision of [Alessandro Cimatti](https://es.fbk.eu/people/cimatti/),
[Roberto Sebastiani](http://disi.unitn.it/rseba/),
and [Alberto Griggio](https://es.fbk.eu/people/griggio/).
